### Storm Events 
This project was an exploratory analysis of Storm Events data from NOAA/NCDC. It contains plots of storms by type, location, and time, as well as the damage and injuries/fatalities caused by storms. 

### Turkey 
This project was for the Kaggle competition: Don't Call Me Turkey. The goal was to classify a sound clip on whether or not it was a turkey sound. My model is a dense neural network made with Keras/Tensorflow.
